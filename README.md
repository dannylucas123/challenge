# Environment variables
Before running the project be sure to copy the .env.dev file (or rename it). Remove the .dev so that it becomes just ".env". Add your apikey to the file.

# Webpack loaders
- html-webpack-plugin to inject our Javascript bundle into our index.html automatically.
- MiniCssExtractPlugin to create one fancy css from all our css files.
- sass-loader enables support for SCSS files, turning scss into css, which is then read by css-loader and injected by style-loader.
- css-loader collects all the css we reference in our javascript and turns it into a string
- style-loader injects the css string created by css-loader into the page.
